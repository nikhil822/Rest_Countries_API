# Important Update!

Restcountries.eu is now called countrylayer API. They've updated their terms of use and introduced a subscription based service - with a free tier of course, limited to 100 requests per day. You need an access key in order to query data from the API.

Therefore, the code in this repository won't work (as far as I've tested). Check [this](https://github.com/SankThomas/country-layer-api-demo) repository for the demo on the new API. I will be releasing a YouTube video soon as the one I made for the previous API has been rendered obsolete. Thank you.

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_
